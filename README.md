# AMDMWE.jl
Reproducer repo for GLMakie AMD gpu bug reported here: https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/issues/1460
In the current state, this doesn't reproduce the issue, even though it should use a pretty similar setup as GLMakie. So, this just narrows it down, but doesn't help debugging it much.

To check it out, clone repository and run `mwe.jl`
